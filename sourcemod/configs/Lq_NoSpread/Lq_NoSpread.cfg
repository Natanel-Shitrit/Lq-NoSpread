		// NOTE:
		// The plugin will never cancel weapon accuracy! (change accurate weapon to be inaccurate while standing still / sit walking)
		// To clarify: it will cancel the the *NO-SPREAD* if the 'enable_all' is 1 and one of the options of the weapon is not correct.

		// Avilable Options:
		// • "scoped" - Checks if the weapon is scoped (will check even if the weapon doesn't have a scope).
		// • "mid-air" - Checks if the player is not touching the ground.
		// • "velocity_min" / "velocity_max" - range of velocity to applay the nospread.
		
		// Options Values:(Default value is -1, means if you don't specify the value it won't effect when checking)
		// -1 - don't check, always give nospread.
		//  0 - only when the option is false.
		//  1 - only when the option is true.
		
		// This is an example.
		// This will enable the no spread for the AWP only when the player is scoped, standing on the ground and his velocity is between 0 to 350.
		// feel free to change this to how you like, and add more weapons :)
